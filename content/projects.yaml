    Founded in 2018, Afflytics was a provider of affiliate program management for digital media publishers.

    Publishers could use their unified dashboard to check affiliate program earnings. This saved the publisher countless hours each day not having to log in to each individual programâ€™s dashboard.

    Afflytics has been featured by top brands in the space such as Flippa, Niche Pursuits, WP Mayor, and more.
